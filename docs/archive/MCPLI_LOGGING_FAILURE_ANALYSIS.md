# MCPLI Logging Implementation Failure Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the failed attempts to implement a simple logging architecture for MCPLI: capturing MCP server stderr and forwarding it to macOS OSLog for live streaming via `mcpli daemon logs`. Despite multiple days of attempts and various approaches, **the core requirement remains unfulfilled**: MCP server stderr is not being captured and forwarded to OSLog.

## Requirements (Simple and Clear)

The requirements were straightforward:

1. **MCP server stderr capture**: Daemon should capture stderr output from the MCP server process
2. **Forward to OSLog**: Captured stderr should be forwarded to macOS OSLog with `[MCPLI:daemonId]` prefixes
3. **Live streaming**: `mcpli daemon logs -- <command>` should stream live logs from OSLog for the specified daemon
4. **No file-based logging**: Use OSLog exclusively (no disk files)

## Timeline of Failures

### Initial Context (Prior to Detailed Analysis)
The conversation began with a continuation from a previous session where OSLog integration was partially implemented but MCP server stderr was not being captured.

### Commit Analysis

#### 1. Commit 512ad7e - "Remove --logs CLI flag" (2025-09-01 11:26:07)
**What was attempted:**
- Removed --logs flag from CLI parsing
- Updated daemon wrapper to always forward stderr to OSLog
- Added comprehensive audit documents

**What failed:**
- The underlying stderr capture mechanism was still not working
- Changes were architectural but didn't address the core technical issue

#### 2. Commit 613963c - "OSLog integration for daemon log viewing" (2025-09-01 11:41:06)  
**What was attempted:**
- Added command-specific log filtering using daemon IDs
- Updated `daemon logs` command to filter by specific daemon ID
- Fixed predicate to use `eventMessage CONTAINS "[MCPLI:daemonId]"`

**What worked:**
- Daemon ID computation and filtering logic ✅
- OSLog command construction ✅

**What failed:**
- No actual MCP server logs were appearing in OSLog ❌

#### 3. Commit 4b86b1d - "Complete OSLog integration" (2025-09-01 12:00:13)
**What was attempted:**
- **ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION**: Changed from live streaming to historical log viewing using `log show`
- Added daemon startup logging to OSLog using `/usr/bin/logger`
- Implemented MCP server stderr capture framework with `handleMCPStderr()`

**What worked:**
- Daemon startup messages successfully logged to OSLog ✅
- OSLog filtering and viewing infrastructure ✅

**What failed:**
- **Critical architectural violation**: Changed streaming to historical (without permission)
- MCP server stderr capture still not working ❌
- `handleMCPStderr()` method never being called ❌

#### 4. Commit af2ba3c - "Restore streaming functionality" (2025-09-01 12:05:39)
**What was attempted:**
- Reverted inappropriate change from historical to streaming logs
- Fixed predicate to use `eventMessage CONTAINS` for streaming

**What worked:**
- Restored original streaming architecture as requested ✅

**What still failed:**
- Core stderr capture issue remained unresolved ❌

## Technical Analysis of Failures

### Root Cause Investigation

#### RepoPrompt Analysis Summary
Based on RepoPrompt chat history, previous attempts included:

1. **StdioClientTransport Configuration Issues:**
   - Attempted `stderr: 'pipe'` configuration
   - Tried `stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']` override
   - Transport's private `_childProcess` property access

2. **Child Process Access Problems:**
   - Multiple attempts to access child process from transport
   - Tried various property names: `_childProcess`, `process`, `child`, `childProcess`
   - Added extensive debugging and error handling

3. **Timing Issues:**
   - Attempted to attach stderr listeners before and after transport connect
   - Added spawn event handlers
   - Multiple attachment strategies to handle timing

### Core Technical Issues Identified

#### 1. **StdioClientTransport Stderr Access**
The MCP SDK's `StdioClientTransport` appears to not expose the child process stderr in a way that allows interception:

```typescript
// This approach consistently failed:
const childProcess = (transport as any)._childProcess;
if (childProcess?.stderr) {
  childProcess.stderr.on('data', (data: Buffer) => {
    // This event handler was NEVER called
  });
}
```

**Evidence of failure:**
- Debug logs showed `childProcess` existed but stderr events never fired
- No stderr data was ever captured despite MCP server writing to stderr
- `handleMCPStderr()` method calls were confirmed to never execute

#### 2. **MCP Server Stderr Output Verification**
The test server (`test-server.js`) was confirmed to write to stderr:

```javascript
// test-server.js lines 78, 83, 86, 88, 93, 101
console.error(`[TOOL] echo called with message: ${args.message}`);
console.error(`[TOOL] fail called with message: ${args.message || 'no message'}`);  
console.error('Simple Test MCP Server running...');
```

**Evidence of stderr output:**
- Manual verification showed test server writes to stderr on startup and tool calls
- The stderr output exists but is not being captured by our daemon

#### 3. **Daemon Process Environment**
The daemon runs under launchd (PID 1 parent), which should theoretically support stderr redirection:

```bash
# Process verification:
$ ps -p 73621 -o pid,ppid,command
  PID  PPID COMMAND
73621     1 /opt/homebrew/Cellar/node/24.2.0/bin/node /Volumes/Developer/mcpli/dist/daemon/wrapper.js
```

**Launchd Configuration:**
- Daemon is properly managed by launchd ✅
- Socket activation working correctly ✅
- Process lifecycle managed correctly ✅

#### 4. **OSLog Integration Partial Success**
OSLog integration works for manually written logs:

```typescript
// This works - daemon startup logs appear in OSLog:
const logger = spawn('/usr/bin/logger', ['-t', 'mcpli'], { stdio: 'pipe' });
logger.stdin.write(`[MCPLI:${this.daemonId}] Daemon started and MCP client connected\n`);
```

**Evidence of OSLog success:**
```bash
2025-09-01 11:55:46.492 Df logger[75170:10b42f8] [MCPLI:b3716a57] Daemon started and MCP client connected
```

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### Attempt 1: Basic Stderr Pipe Configuration
```typescript
const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: resolvedCommand,
  args: this.mcpArgs,
  env: { ...baseEnv, ...this.serverEnv },
  stderr: 'pipe', // ❌ This configuration was ignored or ineffective
});
```

**Result:** No stderr capture, `stderr: 'pipe'` appears to have no effect on StdioClientTransport.

### Attempt 2: Force Stdio Pipes Override
```typescript
const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: resolvedCommand,
  args: this.mcpArgs,
  env: { ...baseEnv, ...this.serverEnv },
  stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe'], // ❌ Caused daemon startup timeouts
} as any);
```

**Result:** Daemon failed to start properly, indicating `stdio` override breaks transport functionality.

### Attempt 3: Multi-Strategy Child Process Access
```typescript
private handleMCPStderr(transport: StdioClientTransport): void {
  const childProcess = (transport as any)._childProcess;
  
  // Attempted multiple attachment points:
  // - Before connect
  // - After connect  
  // - On spawn event
  
  if (childProcess?.stderr) {
    childProcess.stderr.on('data', (data: Buffer) => {
      // ❌ This handler was NEVER executed
    });
  }
}
```

**Result:** Event handlers attached successfully but never received data events.

### Attempt 4: OSLog Historical Workaround (Architectural Violation)
```typescript
// ❌ Changed from streaming to historical - not acceptable
const logCommand = `/usr/bin/log show --style compact --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "[MCPLI:${daemonId}]"' --last 1h`;
```

**Result:** Technical approach worked but violated architectural requirements (streaming vs historical).

## Debugging Evidence Collected

### 1. **Process Hierarchy Verification**
```bash
$ ./dist/mcpli.js daemon status
Daemon b3716a57:
  Label: com.mcpli.13175e13.b3716a57  
  Loaded: yes
  Running: yes
  PID: 73621
```

### 2. **OSLog Manual Testing**  
```bash
# Manual logger test - SUCCESS:
$ echo "test manual logger" | /usr/bin/logger -t "mcpli-test"

# Historical log verification - SUCCESS:
$ /usr/bin/log show --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "test manual logger"' --last 1m
2025-09-01 11:55:58.721 Df logger[75674:10b4a07] test manual logger
```

### 3. **Daemon Startup Logging - SUCCESS:**
```bash
$ /usr/bin/log show --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "[MCPLI:"' --last 1h
2025-09-01 11:55:46.492 Df logger[75170:10b42f8] [MCPLI:b3716a57] Daemon started and MCP client connected
```

### 4. **MCP Server Stderr Search - FAILURE:**
```bash
# Searching for MCP server stderr - NO RESULTS:
$ /usr/bin/log show --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "echo called"' --last 30s
# No results found despite tool execution
```

## Working Components (Partial Success)

### ✅ What Works:
1. **Daemon Management**: Daemons start, stop, and manage lifecycle correctly
2. **OSLog Infrastructure**: Can write to OSLog using `/usr/bin/logger`  
3. **Log Filtering**: Daemon ID-based filtering works properly
4. **Log Streaming**: `log stream` command works with correct predicates
5. **Daemon Startup Logging**: Daemon lifecycle events logged to OSLog

### ❌ What Fails:
1. **MCP Server Stderr Capture**: Core requirement completely unmet
2. **Transport Integration**: Cannot access stderr from StdioClientTransport
3. **Live MCP Logging**: No MCP server logs reach OSLog for streaming

## Architecture Analysis

### Current Architecture (Broken)
```
MCP Server Process
    ├── stdout → Terminal (✅ works)
    └── stderr → ??? (❌ lost, not captured)

Daemon Process  
    ├── Manual logs → OSLog via logger (✅ works)
    └── MCP stderr → ??? (❌ not captured)

mcpli daemon logs
    └── OSLog stream → Terminal (✅ works, but no data)
```

### Required Architecture (Not Achieved)
```
MCP Server Process
    ├── stdout → Terminal  
    └── stderr → Daemon Process → OSLog

Daemon Process
    ├── MCP stderr capture → OSLog via logger
    └── Manual logs → OSLog via logger

mcpli daemon logs  
    └── OSLog stream → Terminal (with MCP logs)
```

## Attempted Solutions Summary

### Solution Categories:
1. **Transport Configuration**: stderr: 'pipe', stdio overrides
2. **Child Process Access**: Multiple property access attempts  
3. **Event Handler Timing**: Before/after connect, spawn events
4. **OSLog Integration**: logger command, predicate fixes
5. **Debugging Infrastructure**: Extensive logging and verification

### None Successfully Captured MCP Stderr

Despite ~20+ different technical approaches across multiple days:
- Various transport configurations
- Different child process access methods  
- Multiple event attachment strategies
- Comprehensive debugging and verification
- OSLog integration from multiple angles

**The core issue remains unresolved**: MCP server stderr is never captured by the daemon.

## Research Questions for Alternative Approaches

Based on this comprehensive failure analysis, these questions need investigation:

1. **MCP SDK Architecture**: Does StdioClientTransport intentionally prevent stderr access for security/design reasons?

2. **Transport Alternatives**: Are there alternative MCP transport implementations that provide stderr access?

3. **Process Interception**: Could stderr be captured at the OS level before the transport spawns the child?

4. **Daemon Environment**: Is there something about the launchd daemon environment that prevents child process stderr capture?

5. **MCP Protocol Design**: Does the MCP protocol specification have guidance on logging/stderr handling?

## Attempted Debugging Techniques

### Infrastructure Verification:
- ✅ Daemon process hierarchy confirmed  
- ✅ OSLog infrastructure working
- ✅ Manual logger command functional
- ✅ Log filtering and streaming operational
- ✅ MCP server stderr output confirmed

### Code Verification:
- ✅ Event handlers properly attached
- ✅ Child process object accessible  
- ✅ No TypeScript/runtime errors
- ✅ Proper async/await handling
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive

### System Integration:
- ✅ launchd daemon management working
- ✅ Socket activation functional
- ✅ IPC communication operational  
- ✅ Process lifecycle management
- ✅ Environment variable handling

## Key Technical Mysteries

### 1. **StdioClientTransport Stderr Behavior**
Why does the child process stderr stream exist but never emit 'data' events?

```typescript
// This logs true, but events never fire:
console.error(`childProcess.stderr exists: ${!!childProcess?.stderr}`);
childProcess.stderr.on('data', () => {
  // NEVER EXECUTED
});
```

### 2. **Transport Internal Implementation**
Is StdioClientTransport internally consuming stderr in a way that prevents external access?

### 3. **Daemon Environment Interaction**
Does running under launchd affect child process stdio inheritance in unexpected ways?

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have:
- Functional daemon infrastructure ✅
- Working OSLog integration ✅  
- Correct log filtering and streaming ✅
- Daemon lifecycle logging ✅
- Comprehensive error handling ✅

### What We're Missing:
- **The core feature**: MCP server stderr capture ❌
- Any MCP server logs in OSLog ❌
- Ability to monitor MCP server errors ❌
- Complete logging solution ❌

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience Impact:
- `mcpli daemon logs -- command` shows only daemon lifecycle events
- No MCP server errors or debugging information available  
- No way to monitor MCP server health or issues
- Missing critical operational visibility

### Development Impact:
- Cannot debug MCP server issues through MCPLI
- No centralized logging for MCP server applications
- Breaks the promised OSLog integration feature
- Incomplete feature delivery despite significant development effort

## Resource Investment Analysis

### Time Invested:
- Multiple days of development effort
- Extensive debugging and verification
- Multiple architectural approaches attempted
- Comprehensive testing and validation

### Code Changes:
- Major modifications to daemon wrapper
- CLI argument parsing changes
- OSLog integration implementation  
- Multiple commit iterations and fixes

### Technical Debt Created:
- Non-functional stderr capture code
- Misleading user-facing commands
- Partial feature implementation
- Incomplete architecture

## Conclusion

After extensive analysis, the fundamental issue is clear: **the MCP SDK's StdioClientTransport does not provide accessible stderr capture capability**. Despite multiple approaches and significant development effort, the core requirement cannot be met with the current technical approach.

The failure represents a gap between:
1. **User Requirements**: Simple stderr → OSLog forwarding
2. **Technical Reality**: MCP SDK limitations prevent stderr access
3. **Architectural Assumptions**: Belief that child process stderr could be intercepted

## Recommendation for Future Research

The evidence strongly suggests that the current approach (intercepting stderr from StdioClientTransport) is fundamentally flawed. Alternative approaches requiring investigation:

1. **MCP SDK Source Analysis**: Deep dive into StdioClientTransport implementation
2. **Alternative Transport Development**: Custom transport with stderr access
3. **OS-Level Process Interception**: Capture stderr before MCP SDK involvement
4. **MCP Protocol Extension**: Propose logging extensions to MCP specification  
5. **External Process Monitoring**: Monitor child processes independently

# RESEARCH PROMPT FOR AI ASSISTANT

You are tasked with researching solutions for a specific technical problem involving the Model Context Protocol (MCP) TypeScript SDK. This research should focus on publicly available information, documentation, and community resources.

## Problem Statement

**Objective**: Capture stderr output from MCP server processes spawned by the MCP TypeScript SDK's `StdioClientTransport` for logging and monitoring purposes.

**Context**: Building a daemon that manages MCP servers and needs to capture their stderr output for operational logging. The MCP servers write error messages and debug information to stderr, but these need to be captured and forwarded to a centralized logging system.

## MCP SDK Background (Public Information)

**Repository**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk
**Package**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk  
**Transport**: StdioClientTransport (client-side stdio transport)

The MCP TypeScript SDK provides `StdioClientTransport` for communication with stdio-based MCP servers:

```typescript
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js';
import { StdioClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js';
```

## Attempted Implementation (Failed)

Here's what has been tried unsuccessfully:

### Attempt 1: Basic stderr Configuration
```typescript
import { StdioClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js';
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js';

// Attempted to configure stderr as 'pipe' 
const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: 'node',
  args: ['mcp-server.js'],
  env: {},
  stderr: 'pipe'  // ❌ This appears to have no effect
});

const client = new Client({
  name: 'my-client',
  version: '1.0.0'
}, { capabilities: {} });

await client.connect(transport);
```

**Result**: The `stderr: 'pipe'` option appears to be ignored. No stderr capture occurs.

### Attempt 2: Child Process Access
```typescript
// Attempted to access the underlying child process
const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: 'node', 
  args: ['mcp-server.js'],
  env: {}
});

await client.connect(transport);

// Try to access internal child process (various attempts)
const childProcess = (transport as any)._childProcess;
// Also tried: .process, .child, .childProcess

if (childProcess?.stderr) {
  childProcess.stderr.on('data', (data: Buffer) => {
    console.log('Captured stderr:', data.toString());
    // ❌ This event handler is NEVER called
  });
}
```

**Result**: While `childProcess` object exists, stderr events never fire despite MCP server writing to stderr.

### Attempt 3: Stdio Override
```typescript
// Attempted to force stdio configuration
const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: 'node',
  args: ['mcp-server.js'], 
  env: {},
  stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']  // ❌ Caused transport failures
} as any);
```

**Result**: This breaks the transport entirely - connection fails and daemon doesn't start.

### Attempt 4: Multiple Attachment Strategies
```typescript
class MCPDaemon {
  private attachStderrListener(transport: StdioClientTransport) {
    // Try various property names that might contain child process
    const child: any = 
      (transport as any).process ??
      (transport as any)._process ??
      (transport as any).child ??
      (transport as any).childProcess ?? 
      null;
      
    if (child?.stderr) {
      if (!(child.stderr as any).__listenerAttached) {
        (child.stderr as any).__listenerAttached = true;
        child.stderr.on('data', (chunk: Buffer) => {
          this.handleStderr(chunk); // ❌ Never called
        });
      }
    }
  }
  
  async startMCP() {
    const transport = new StdioClientTransport({ /* ... */ });
    
    // Try attaching before connect
    this.attachStderrListener(transport);
    
    await client.connect(transport);
    
    // Try attaching after connect  
    this.attachStderrListener(transport);
    
    // Try listening for spawn event
    const child = (transport as any)._childProcess;
    if (child?.once) {
      child.once('spawn', () => {
        this.attachStderrListener(transport);
      });
    }
  }
}
```

**Result**: Handlers attach successfully but never receive data events.

## Confirmed Behavior

### MCP Server DOES Write to Stderr
Test MCP server code that definitely writes to stderr:
```javascript
// Example MCP server that writes to stderr
import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js';
import { StdioServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js';

const server = new Server({
  name: 'test-server',
  version: '1.0.0'
}, { capabilities: { tools: {} } });

server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {
  console.error('[TOOL] Server received list_tools request'); // ✅ This DOES write to stderr
  return { tools: [] };
});

server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  console.error(`[TOOL] Server executing tool: ${request.params.name}`); // ✅ This DOES write to stderr
  return { content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Tool executed' }] };
});

// Server startup logging
console.error('MCP Test Server starting...'); // ✅ This DOES write to stderr
```

When run directly: `node mcp-server.js`, these stderr messages appear in the terminal.

### Transport Functionality Works
The MCP client-server communication works perfectly:
- ✅ Tool discovery works
- ✅ Tool execution works  
- ✅ Request/response flow works
- ✅ MCP protocol compliance maintained

**Only stderr capture fails.**

### Research Scope
- **Focus on publicly available information** (GitHub repos, documentation, community discussions)
- **Prioritize implementable solutions** over theoretical approaches
- **Include working code examples** where possible
- **Document compatibility considerations** with different Node.js versions, OS environments

---

*This research is needed because standard child process stderr capture techniques do not work with the MCP TypeScript SDK's StdioClientTransport, despite the transport successfully spawning child processes and managing MCP communication. The underlying MCP servers DO write to stderr, but this output is not accessible through normal Node.js child process patterns.*
