Packing repository using Repomix...
Analyzing repository using gemini-2.5-pro...
Of course. Here is a comprehensive cleanup review of the MCPLI project, analyzing the codebase for dead code, outdated documentation, and redundant files as requested.

### Executive Summary

The MCPLI project has recently undergone a significant and successful architectural refactor, moving from a manual lockfile-based daemon system to a more robust `launchd`-based architecture for macOS. This review identifies several artifacts from the previous architecture, including dead code, obsolete documentation, and unused dependencies, that can be safely removed to reduce confusion and improve maintainability.

The core application logic (`src/mcpli.ts`, `src/daemon/`) and primary architecture documents (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/process_architecture.md`) are modern and well-maintained. The cleanup should focus on auxiliary files and documentation that have not been updated since the architectural pivot.

---

### 1. Dead Code Analysis

The following code and dependencies are unused in the current implementation and can be safely removed.

*   **File to Remove**: `src/mcpli-backup.ts`
    *   **Reasoning**: This file is an old, stateless version of the main CLI entry point. It is not imported or used anywhere in the build process or application logic. Its presence is confusing, and the `eslint.config.js` file explicitly ignores it, confirming it is not part of the active codebase.

*   **Unused Dependency**: `proper-lockfile`
    *   **Reasoning**: This dependency is listed in `package.json` but is no longer used in the source code. The project's architecture was refactored to use macOS `launchd` for process management, which made the file-locking mechanism provided by this package obsolete. A global search confirms there are no imports or requires for `proper-lockfile`.
    *   **Action**: Run `npm uninstall proper-lockfile`.

### 2. Obsolete and Out-of-Date Documentation

Several documentation files contain information that is either completely wrong due to the architectural refactor (dead) or does not accurately reflect the current state of the code (out-of-date).

*   **File to Rewrite**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
    *   **Reasoning**: This document is **severely outdated**. It refers to a non-existent file structure and an obsolete daemon architecture. Specifically, it instructs contributors to look at `src/daemon/spawn.ts` and `src/daemon/lock.ts`, neither of which exist anymore. The entire "Architecture Overview" and "Development Workflow" sections need to be rewritten to reflect the current `runtime.ts` / `runtime-launchd.ts` implementation.

*   **File to Rewrite**: `CLAUDE.md`
    *   **Reasoning**: Similar to `CONTRIBUTING.md`, this file is **critically outdated and internally inconsistent**. It references the old file structure (`spawn.ts`, `lock.ts`) and describes the old lockfile-based daemon lifecycle. This directly contradicts the current `launchd`-based implementation and will mislead any AI assistant using it for context.

*   **File to Update**: `docs/testing.md`
    *   **Reasoning**: This document is mostly accurate but contains a minor discrepancy. It states that there are 21 automated tests passing across unit, integration, and E2E suites. However, an analysis of the test files shows that the E2E tests (`tests/e2e/cli.test.ts`) and CLI parser unit tests (`tests/unit/cli-parser.test.ts`) are currently skipped. The document should be updated to reflect the current state of the test suite to provide an accurate picture of test coverage.

### 3. Unused Scripts and Redundant Files

The repository contains a few files that are either artifacts from tooling or serve a redundant purpose.

*   **File to Remove**: `cleanup-analysis.md`
    *   **Reasoning**: This file contains only the text "Packing repository using Repomix..." and appears to be a junk artifact from a packaging tool. It serves no purpose and can be safely deleted.

*   **Potentially Redundant Script**: `scripts/test-regression.sh`
    *   **Reasoning**: This shell script provides a valuable regression test suite that is executed against the built artifacts. However, the project also has a `vitest`-based E2E test suite in `tests/e2e/cli.test.ts` that is currently disabled. If the `vitest` E2E tests were enabled and expanded, this shell script would become redundant.
    *   **Recommendation**: For now, keep this script as it appears to be the primary E2E testing mechanism. However, a tracking issue should be created to migrate these tests to the `vitest` framework and eventually deprecate this script.

*   **Historical Audit Files**: `audit/` directory
    *   **Reasoning**: The files within the `audit/` directory (`CODE_DRIVEN_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `MCPLI_LOGGING_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md`, `MCPLI-Critique-RCA-Redesign.md`) are historical analyses and records of past states of the project. While they contain valuable context about the project's evolution, they are not "living" documents and can be confused with current architectural documentation.
    *   **Recommendation**: To clarify their status, move these files to a new `docs/archive/` or `audit/archive/` directory. This preserves the project history while signaling that they are not reflective of the current implementation.

### Summary of Cleanup Recommendations

1.  **Delete Files**:
    *   `src/mcpli-backup.ts`
    *   `cleanup-analysis.md`

2.  **Update `package.json`**:
    *   Run `npm uninstall proper-lockfile`.

3.  **Rewrite Documentation**:
    *   `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Update architecture, file structure, and dev workflow).
    *   `CLAUDE.md` (Update to reflect the current `launchd` architecture).

4.  **Update Documentation**:
    *   `docs/testing.md` (Note that E2E tests are currently skipped).

5.  **Archive Historical Files**:
    *   Move the contents of the `audit/` directory to an archive sub-directory (e.g., `docs/archive/`).

By addressing these items, the repository will be cleaner, more maintainable, and provide a more accurate and less confusing experience for new contributors and automated tools.
